"DESCRIPTION" : This project demonstrates how to integrate a public weather API (OpenWeatherMap) with Python to fetch and visualize real-time weather forecast data. The script sends an API request for a selected city (e.g., Chennai), extracts relevant weather parameters such as temperature and humidity, and then visualizes the results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

"OUTCOME" : The project results in a visual dashboard that provides insight into upcoming weather conditions. It demonstrates real-world usage of API consumption and data visualization, fulfilling the objectives of hands-on experience with modern Python development tools.

"TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED" : requests – To fetch data from OpenWeatherMap API
                             matplotlib – For plotting temperature and humidity trends
                             seaborn – For enhanced and styled data visualization
                             datetime – To convert and format timestamp data
